# Crowdfunding_ETL

## Introduction

This repository is an ETL project worked on by William Gray Renton, Amber Venes, and Andrew Montemayor.

## Project

The Project folder contains all contents.

In order to run our notebooks you must do the following:

1. Run the ETL_Mini_Project_AMontemayor_AVenes_WRenton python notebook to extract and clean data from the contacts and crowdfunding excel files.
2. Create a SQL database titled crowdfunding_db
3. In SQL run the crowdfunding_db_schema file from the ERD folder.
4. Run the LOAD_WRITE python notebook to load data into new database.
5. Run the ANALYSIS_READ python notebook to check out the analysis of the database.

### ERD

This folder contains [an image of our ERD](Project/ERD/QuickDBD_diagram.png), the schema, and the schema pseudocode.

### Resources

This folder contains the contacts and crowdfunding excel files.

It also contains four CSV files created by the ETL_Mini_Project_AMontemayor_AVenes_WRenton python notebook.
